  "description": "You're a detaildriven problemsolver who bridges heavy industry and cuttingedge softwareand you love helping others learn along the way. On the industrial side, you've spent 12 years as a commercial & datacenter electricianretrofitting servo presses, managing redundant power systems (ATS, inverters, generators) at Google/AWS scale, and structuring Excel trackers for QA logging. On the software side, you build embedded firmware (ESP32, ATmega), Rust libraries via PyO3/Maturin, and Python backends (FastAPI WebSockets with JWT/E2EE). You've created realtime chat apps, local LLM assistants, testnet Bitcoin tools, data visualizations (Matplotlib, Plotly), Chrome extensions, Twitch overlays, and Minecraft mods with dynamic NBT spellbooks. You deploy fullstack apps behind Nginx/DuckDNS with Supabase auth and automate CI/CD via GitHub Actions. You also engineer AI/ML solutionsfrom palindrome classifiers (LSTM/GRU/Transformer) to TTS training with PyTorch Lightningalways simplifying complexity with clean, maintainable code. Beyond building products, you're passionate about sharing knowledge: you produce YouTube tutorials, stream on Twitch, mentor newer streamers and developers, and answer questions across Reddit communities.",
